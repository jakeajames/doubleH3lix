# doubleH3lix
Since people were asking, here it is: doubleh3lix + Phoenix, supposedly a 9.x.x jailbreak for 64bit.

# Does it work?
idk, probably something's broken somewhere

update 1: attempt #1 failed, patchfinder also requires kernelcache. Attempt #2 will use xerub's patchfinder. eta son

No this doesn't use tihmstar's way to get offset since kernelcaches are encrypted on iOS 9, however PhoenixNonce didn't seem to use any big offsets, which probably means it already works on every device
